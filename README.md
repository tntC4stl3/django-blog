Django Blog
===========

This is the source code of my personal blog.

The theme is based on the [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/flex) which I used in my previous pelican blog, I copy it to here and keep the most feature it supports.

Also I want to use this repository to try some integration tools like Travis or other on Github, so it will work like an experiment laboratory.
